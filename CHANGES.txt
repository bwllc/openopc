RELEASE NOTES (John Ladasky to update)
February 11, 2012


1. In previous versions of OpenOPC the Gateway Service would sometimes fail
to bind to a TCP port, thus causing the service to not listen for incoming
connections.  This would only occur on systems containing multiple ethernet
interfaces and the failure would not be consistent or predictible.

In such situations you can now tell the Gateway Service which ethernet
interface to bind to by setting the OPC_GATE_HOST system enviornment
variable equal to the IP address of the desired ethernet interface.

It is recommended that this setting be made on all computers with more
than one active ethernet interface.   System environment variables can
be set using the "System" applet inside the Windows Control Panel.

2. In some cases the opc.read() function would attempt to automatically
destoy an OPC group that no longer existed.  This would result in an
exception being thrown.  This bug has been fixed.

3. The OpenOPC installer has been updated to check for multiple versions
of Python when installing the Development Library.   Previous versions
of the installer only checked for the older Python 2.5.

4. The included opc.exe and OpenOPCService.exe executibles have been
built using Python 3.4+ and Pyro4.  Older versions were built using
Pyro 3.10 which is not protocol compatible with the newer Pyro 3.15.
Thus you cannot use a prior version of the client with the newer gateway
service or vice versa.   Please update all your instances of OpenOPC
at the same time in order to avoid this compatibility issue.

5. OpenOPC has been tested with Python 3.4. Previous versions
are not supported.

6. OpenOPC has been tested with Windows 7 (64-bit).  Previous versions
were only tested using Windows Server 2003 and XP.

7. The opc.py and OpenOPCService.py code has been modifed to work with
PyInstaller.  Previous versions could only be built using py2exe.
